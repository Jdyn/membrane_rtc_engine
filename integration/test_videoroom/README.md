# TestVideoroom

Test application for running integration tests on `membrane_rtc_engine`.

Very simple phoenix app with just a single page allowing to join a single room.

## Page functionalities
* joining the room
* leaving the room
* displaying statistics about current participant's remote streams


# TODO: add description how statistics are versioned so it is easier for test suit to access them asynchronously
